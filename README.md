I needed to make a realtime line graphy thing for an industrial app.
Technicians will be calibrating a part of a `machine`.
This graphy thingy will be used to display the `output signal` from the 
`machine` it has horizontal bars to show the current value and a max value.

For quick testing it just uses random values.
